Overview: This project analyzes customer churn using Power BI, SQL, and Machine Learning to identify patterns, predict churn, and provide retention strategies.
Key Components:
Data Preparation (SQL):
Extracted and cleaned customer data using SQL, focusing on demographics, contract info, and churn indicators.
Transformed data to create features like contract length and customer age groups.
Exploratory Analysis (Power BI):
Visualized customer segments by demographics, contract types, and service usage.
Built KPIs such as churn rate, ARPU, and customer lifetime value (CLTV).
Predictive Modeling (ML):
Built models (Logistic Regression/Decision Trees) to predict churn, using key features identified in SQL/Power BI.
Evaluated models with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Power BI Dashboards:
Created interactive dashboards to visualize churn predictions and trends.
Filters enabled insights by demographic and contract factors.
Recommendations:
Offered strategies for customer retention based on high-risk churn predictions.
Suggested targeted marketing and contract flexibility.
Tools: SQL, Power BI, Python (Machine Learning), DAX
