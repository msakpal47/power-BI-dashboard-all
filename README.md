Project Overview: Pizza Sales Dashboard

Objective: To analyze pizza sales data and create an interactive Power BI dashboard providing key insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and business performance.

Key Project Phases:
1. Data Collection and Understanding:
Dataset: Pizza sales data, including order details, customer information, pizza types, sales regions, and time stamps.
Sources: Data can be extracted from CSV files, relational databases, or Excel sheets.
Data Structure: Includes tables for:
Orders: Order ID, Pizza Type, Date/Time, Quantity, Total Price.
Customers: Customer ID, Name, Location, Age.
Pizza Types: Pizza ID, Size, Ingredients, Price.
Sales Regions: Region ID, City, Store Name.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (SQL):
SQL Queries:
Remove duplicates and null values.
Normalize customer and pizza data (if needed).
Calculate total sales per order by multiplying quantity by price.
Aggregate data to get monthly/weekly sales figures.
Filter data for the most relevant time frames or regions.
Key SQL Tasks:
Join tables (Orders, Customers, Pizza Types, Sales Regions) to create a comprehensive dataset.
Calculate metrics like:
Total Sales (Revenue)
Total Orders
Average Order Value
Top-selling Pizzas
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
3. Data Loading into Power BI:
Import the cleaned data into Power BI for visualization.
Create relationships between tables for dynamic analysis.
4. Dashboard Development (Power BI):
Visualization Requirements:
Sales Trend Analysis: Line chart showing sales over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
Top-selling Pizzas: Bar chart displaying pizza types by sales volume.
Sales by Region: Map visual highlighting regions with the highest/lowest sales.
Customer Demographics: Pie charts or bar graphs breaking down sales by customer age, location, and purchase behavior.
Revenue Breakdown: Donut chart showcasing revenue distribution by pizza size or type.
Key KPIs:
Total Sales
Average Order Value
Top Customers by Revenue
5. Data Insights:
Identify sales trends (e.g., peak sales times, best-selling pizzas).
Understand regional performance and customer preferences.
Assess effectiveness of marketing campaigns or promotions.
Recognize high-value customers and regions with growth potential.
6. Conclusion & Recommendations:
Summarize the insights derived from the dashboard.
Provide data-driven recommendations for business strategy (e.g., promoting popular pizzas, optimizing inventory for high-demand locations, targeting specific customer segments).
Deliverables:
SQL Script: Full SQL code for data cleaning, transformations, and aggregations.
Power BI Dashboard: Interactive dashboard with filters and drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis.
Documentation: Brief report explaining the process, insights, and recommendations for pizza sales optimization.
